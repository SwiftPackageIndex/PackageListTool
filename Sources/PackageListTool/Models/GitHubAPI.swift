    ![The Swift Package Index](.readme-images/swift-package-index.png)

    **The Swift Package Index helps you make better decisions about the dependencies you use in your apps**.

    The [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com) is the place to find packages that are compatible with the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). The project is [open-source](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/blob/main/LICENSE) and written in Swift using [Vapor](https://swiftpackageindex.com/vapor/vapor).

    ## Code of Conduct

    All participation in this project, whether contributing code, communicating in discussions or issues, or pull requests, is subject to our code of conduct. Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

    ## Funding and Sponsorship

    The Swift Package Index is a community project that would not be possible without the support of its sponsors. Thank you to everyone who supports this project!

    ## Contributing

    There are many ways to contribute to the Swift Package Index. Whether it's helping to promote the site, suggesting or discussing a new feature, reporting a bug if you find one, through to helping with bug fixing, or the design/development of the software, we'd love to have you as a contributor.

    To keep our issues list under control, most bug reports or feature requests work best started as a [discussion in our forum](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/discussions). From there, we can promote it into an issue and start work on a pull request. We have plenty of [open issues](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues) if you'd like to get started. We've also tagged some with a [good first issue](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label.

    We also have a Discord server. If you'd like to join, please [use this invite](https://discord.gg/vQRb6KkYRw)!

    ### Running the Project Locally

    The best place to start is our in-depth guide to [setting up the Swift Package Index for local development](LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md)! If you run into any problems, please [start a discussion](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/discussions) or [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/vQRb6KkYRw).

    ### Contributor License Agreements

    The Swift Package Index is [licensed under the Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE). Before we can accept your contributions, you'll need to sign a standard Apache 2.0 Contributor License Agreement. We will organise this during your first pull request.
